Looking at the error message and your files, the issue seems to be in how file paths are being handled in the PowerShell script. The message "The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect" typically indicates problems with special characters or formatting in file paths.

The problem is likely in how `elevate.ps1` receives and processes the path from `elevate_wrapper.bat`. Let's fix it by modifying the PowerShell script to better handle path formatting:

---

```diff
  param([string]$AppPath)
  
- # Normalize path
- $AppPath = $AppPath.Trim('"')  # Remove any surrounding quotes
- $AppPath = $AppPath.Trim()     # Remove whitespace
- 
- Write-Host ">> AppPath: [$AppPath]"
+ # Better path handling
+ $AppPath = $AppPath.Trim()
+ 
+ Write-Host ">> Original AppPath: [$AppPath]"
+ 
+ # If path is quoted, handle it properly
+ if ($AppPath.StartsWith('"') -and $AppPath.EndsWith('"')) {
+     $AppPath = $AppPath.Substring(1, $AppPath.Length - 2)
+ }
+ 
+ Write-Host ">> Processed AppPath: [$AppPath]"
  
- # Check if file exists
- if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $AppPath)) {
+ # Check if file exists (use LiteralPath to avoid issues with special characters)
+ if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $AppPath -PathType Leaf)) {
      Write-Error "ERROR: App not found at path: $AppPath"
-     Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
+     Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
      exit 1
  }
  
- # Run it elevated
+ # Run it elevated with proper quoting to handle paths with spaces
  try {
-     Start-Process -FilePath $AppPath -Verb RunAs
+     Start-Process -FilePath "$AppPath" -Verb RunAs
  }
  catch {
      Write-Error "FAILED: $($_.Exception.Message)"
-     Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
+     Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
      exit 1
  }
```

---

Now let's update the batch wrapper to ensure it properly passes arguments to the PowerShell script:

---

```diff
  @echo off
- setlocal
+ setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
  
- :: Combine all args to support spaces
- set "ARG="
- :loop
- if "%~1"=="" goto done
-     set "ARG=%ARG% %~1"
-     shift
-     goto loop
- :done
- 
- :: Trim leading space
- set "ARG=%ARG:~1%"
+ :: Preserve the exact command with quotes
+ set "FULL_CMD=%*"
  
  :: Safety check
- if "%ARG%"=="" (
+ if "!FULL_CMD!"=="" (
      echo [ERROR] No executable path provided.
      exit /b 1
  )
  
  :: Debug
- echo Running: %ARG%
- powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "%ARG%"
+ echo Running: !FULL_CMD!
+ powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "!FULL_CMD!"
  
  endlocal
```

---

The changes I've made should fix the error:

1. In `elevate.ps1`:
   - Improved path handling to properly detect and remove quotes
   - Added better debugging output to see both original and processed paths
   - Added the `-PathType Leaf` parameter to specifically check for files
   - Properly quoted the path when passing it to `Start-Process`
   - Increased the sleep time to 5 seconds to give more time to see error messages

2. In `elevate_wrapper.bat`:
   - Simplified the argument handling by using `%*` to capture all arguments exactly as provided
   - Enabled delayed expansion for better variable handling
   - Properly quoted the arguments when passing to PowerShell

These changes should resolve the "filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect" error by ensuring paths with spaces or special characters are properly handled throughout the elevation process.

It looks like the changes to `elevate_wrapper.bat` weren't applied, and the issue persists when trying to elevate `cmd.exe`. Let's try a completely different approach in the PowerShell script to handle elevation:

---

```diff
  param([string]$AppPath)
- 
- # Better path handling
- $AppPath = $AppPath.Trim()
  
  Write-Host ">> Original AppPath: [$AppPath]"
  
- # If path is quoted, handle it properly
+ # Handle quoted paths
  if ($AppPath.StartsWith('"') -and $AppPath.EndsWith('"')) {
      $AppPath = $AppPath.Substring(1, $AppPath.Length - 2)
  Write-Host ">> Processed AppPath: [$AppPath]"
  
- # Check if file exists (use LiteralPath to avoid issues with special characters)
+ # Check if the application exists
  if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $AppPath -PathType Leaf)) {
      Write-Error "ERROR: App not found at path: $AppPath"
  }
  
- # Run it elevated with proper quoting to handle paths with spaces
- try {
-     Start-Process -FilePath "$AppPath" -Verb RunAs
+ # Use Shell.Application COM object for elevation
+ try {
+     Write-Host ">> Attempting to elevate using Shell.Application"
+     $shellApp = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application
+     $shellApp.ShellExecute($AppPath, "", "", "runas")
+     exit 0
+ }
+ catch {
+     Write-Error "FAILED using Shell.Application: $($_.Exception.Message)"
+     
+     # Fall back to Start-Process as a last resort
+     try {
+         Write-Host ">> Falling back to Start-Process"
+         Start-Process -FilePath $AppPath -Verb RunAs
      }
      catch {
          Write-Error "FAILED: $($_.Exception.Message)"
          Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
          exit 1
+     }
  }
```

---

Now let's fix the wrapper batch file, since our previous changes weren't applied:

---

```diff
  @echo off
- setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
+ setlocal
  
- :: Preserve the exact command with quotes
- set "FULL_CMD=%*"
+ :: Get the first argument (expected to be the executable path)
+ set "APP=%~1"
  
  :: Safety check
- if "!FULL_CMD!"=="" (
+ if "%APP%"=="" (
      echo [ERROR] No executable path provided.
      exit /b 1
  )
  
- :: Debug
- echo Running: !FULL_CMD!
- powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "!FULL_CMD!"
+ :: Debug output
+ echo Running: %APP%
+ 
+ :: Call PowerShell script to elevate the application
+ powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "%APP%"
  
  endlocal
```

---

These changes should resolve the issue:

1. In `elevate.ps1`:
   - Completely changed the elevation approach to use the `Shell.Application` COM object
   - Added a fallback to the original `Start-Process` method if the COM approach fails
   - Added more verbose logging for better troubleshooting
   - Preserved the path handling improvements from the previous edit

2. In `elevate_wrapper.bat`:
   - Simplified by focusing on just the first argument (the executable path)
   - Uses `%~1` which properly handles quotes in Windows batch
   - Still passes the path to PowerShell with proper quoting

This approach has several advantages:
- The `Shell.Application` COM object is a more reliable way to elevate privileges in Windows
- We have a fallback mechanism if the primary method fails
- The batch file is simpler and uses Windows' built-in parameter expansion (`%~1`) which handles quoted paths correctly

The combination of these changes should fix the "filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect" error when trying to elevate commands.

Let's try yet another approach by using the native Windows `runas` command directly instead of PowerShell's elevation mechanisms:

---

```diff
  setlocal
  
- :: Get the first argument (expected to be the executable path)
- set "APP=%~1"
+ :: Get the full command line
+ set "COMMAND=%*"
  
  :: Safety check
- if "%APP%"=="" (
-     echo [ERROR] No executable path provided.
+ if "%COMMAND%"=="" (
+     echo [ERROR] No command provided.
+     pause
      exit /b 1
  )
  
- :: Debug output
- echo Running: %APP%
- 
- :: Call PowerShell script to elevate the application
- powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "%APP%"
+ echo ===============================================
+ echo Attempting to elevate: %COMMAND%
+ echo ===============================================
+ 
+ :: Method 1: Try direct runas command first
+ echo Trying runas method...
+ runas /savecred /user:Administrator "%COMMAND%"
+ 
+ :: Method 2: Fallback to PowerShell if needed
+ if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
+     echo Falling back to PowerShell method...
+     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "%COMMAND%"
+ )
  
  endlocal
```

---

Now let's update the PowerShell script to better handle command line arguments and improve diagnostic output:

---

```diff
- param([string]$AppPath)
+ param([string]$Command)
  
- Write-Host ">> Original AppPath: [$AppPath]"
+ Write-Host "-----------------------------------------------------"
+ Write-Host "Elevation Script Diagnostic Information:"
+ Write-Host "-----------------------------------------------------"
+ Write-Host "Input Command: [$Command]"
+ 
+ # Extract the executable path from the command
+ $parts = $Command -split ' '
+ $executablePath = $parts[0]
  
- # Handle quoted paths
- if ($AppPath.StartsWith('"') -and $AppPath.EndsWith('"')) {
-     $AppPath = $AppPath.Substring(1, $AppPath.Length - 2)
+ # Remove quotes if present
+ if ($executablePath.StartsWith('"') -and $executablePath.EndsWith('"')) {
+     $executablePath = $executablePath.Substring(1, $executablePath.Length - 2)
+ }
+ 
+ # Get any arguments
+ $arguments = ""
+ if ($parts.Count -gt 1) {
+     $arguments = $Command.Substring($Command.IndexOf(' ') + 1)
  }
  
- Write-Host ">> Processed AppPath: [$AppPath]"
+ Write-Host "Executable: [$executablePath]"
+ Write-Host "Arguments: [$arguments]"
  
- # Check if the application exists
- if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $AppPath -PathType Leaf)) {
-     Write-Error "ERROR: App not found at path: $AppPath"
+ # Verify file exists
+ if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $executablePath -PathType Leaf)) {
+     Write-Host "ERROR: File not found: $executablePath"
+     Write-Host "Current directory: $(Get-Location)"
+     Write-Host "-----------------------------------------------------"
      Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
      exit 1
  }
  
- # Use Shell.Application COM object for elevation
- try {
-     Write-Host ">> Attempting to elevate using Shell.Application"
+ Write-Host "File exists: $executablePath"
+ Write-Host "Attempting elevation..."
+ Write-Host "-----------------------------------------------------"
+ 
+ # Try multiple elevation methods
+ try {
+     # Method 1: Using ShellExecute
+     Write-Host "Method 1: Using Shell.Application"
      $shellApp = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application
-     $shellApp.ShellExecute($AppPath, "", "", "runas")
+     $shellApp.ShellExecute($executablePath, $arguments, "", "runas")
      exit 0
  }
  catch {
-     Write-Error "FAILED using Shell.Application: $($_.Exception.Message)"
+     Write-Host "Method 1 failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
      
-     # Fall back to Start-Process as a last resort
-     try {
-         Write-Host ">> Falling back to Start-Process"
-         Start-Process -FilePath $AppPath -Verb RunAs
+     try {
+         # Method 2: Using Start-Process
+         Write-Host "Method 2: Using Start-Process"
+         if ($arguments) {
+             Start-Process -FilePath $executablePath -ArgumentList $arguments -Verb RunAs
+         } else {
+             Start-Process -FilePath $executablePath -Verb RunAs
+         }
      }
      catch {
-         Write-Error "FAILED: $($_.Exception.Message)"
+         Write-Host "Method 2 failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
+         Write-Host "All elevation methods failed."
          Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
          exit 1
```

---

I've made significant changes to both files to create a more robust elevation system:

1. In `elevate_wrapper.bat`:
   - Now uses the native Windows `runas` command with `/savecred` as the primary method
   - Falls back to the PowerShell approach if `runas` fails
   - Captures and passes the entire command line (`%*`) rather than just the first argument
   - Added better error messages and visual separation for clarity

2. In `elevate.ps1`:
   - Completely rewrote how it handles command lines
   - Now properly separates the executable from any arguments
   - Has much more detailed diagnostics including current directory
   - Shows clear information about what methods are being tried
   - Properly passes arguments to both elevation methods
   - Uses Write-Host instead of Write-Error for better visibility

This dual-method approach should be more reliable:
- The `runas` command is the most direct Windows method for elevation
- If that fails, we have the PowerShell methods as backup
- Both scripts have detailed logging to help identify issues

Try running it again using:
```
C:\Elevator\elevate_wrapper.bat "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"
```

When prompted for credentials by the `runas` command, enter your administrator password. If you've used the `/savecred` option before, it should remember your credentials.

It looks like we're making progress! The script found the executable and tried both methods. The `runas` method failed due to Administrator account restrictions, but the Shell.Application method started without showing immediate errors.

Let's improve both scripts for better compatibility:

---

```diff
  echo ===============================================
  
- :: Method 1: Try direct runas command first
- echo Trying runas method...
- runas /savecred /user:Administrator "%COMMAND%"
- 
- :: Method 2: Fallback to PowerShell if needed

-     echo Falling back to PowerShell method...
-     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "%COMMAND%"
- )
+ :: Skip runas and go directly to PowerShell method which is more reliable
+ echo Using PowerShell elevation method...
+ powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\Elevator\elevate.ps1" "%COMMAND%"
  
  endlocal
```

---

Now let's enhance the PowerShell script to be more reliable and provide better feedback:

---

```diff
  Write-Host "-----------------------------------------------------"
  
- # Try multiple elevation methods
- try {
-     # Method 1: Using ShellExecute

      Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
      exit 1
-     }
  }
```

I've made significant improvements to the elevation system:

1. In `elevate_wrapper.bat`:
   - Removed the `runas` method completely since it was failing with error 1327
   - Added `-NoProfile` and `-WindowStyle Hidden` to the PowerShell invocation for better user experience
   - Simplified the script to focus on the PowerShell method which is more reliable

2. In `elevate.ps1`:
   - Completely redesigned the elevation approach with a dedicated function
   - Implemented three different elevation methods:
     1. An improved Shell.Application COM method that tries two different approaches
     2. The standard Start-Process with RunAs verb
     3. A Task Scheduler method which creates a temporary scheduled task that runs with elevated privileges
   - Added more detailed logging and success/failure reporting
   - Better handling of file paths and arguments

This approach provides multiple fallback options if one method fails, and the Task Scheduler method (Method 3) is particularly effective on systems with UAC restrictions.

Try running it again with:
```
C:\Elevator\elevate_wrapper.bat "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"
```

The script now tries three different elevation methods, improving the chances of success across various Windows configurations.
