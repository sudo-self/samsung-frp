# Inquiry About Command Existence (2025-03-30 19:45:00)

_**User**_

does this command exist @uv

_**Assistant**_



---

Based on the documentation provided, `uv pyinstaller` is not a standard UV command. The main UV commands include `uv python`, `uv pip`, and `uv tool`, but there's no built-in `pyinstaller` subcommand.

This command in the build script is likely using PyInstaller through UV, but the correct syntax would be:

```
uv tool run pyinstaller -F tidal_dl/__init__.py
```

Or you would need to install PyInstaller in your environment first with:
```
uv pip install pyinstaller
```

And then use Python to run it:
```
uv python -m PyInstaller -F tidal_dl/__init__.py
```

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Use 'cd ... || exit' or 'cd ... || return' in case cd fails.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I'll edit the script to add error handling for the `cd` command:

---

```diff
  rm -rf __init__.spec
  
- cd TIDALDL-PY
+ cd TIDALDL-PY || exit
  rm -rf __init__.spec 
  rm -rf dist
```

tidal-dl -l "https://tidal.com/browse/track/419240225?u"

It looks like you're encountering an error with tidal-dl when trying to download a specific track. The error indicates it can't process the "application/dash+xml" stream type.

Possible solutions:

1. Update tidal-dl to the latest version if available
2. Try enabling DASH support in settings (if available):
   ```
   tidal-dl -s
   ```
   Look for DASH or streaming format options

3. Try downloading with a different quality setting:
   ```
   tidal-dl --quality normal -l "https://tidal.com/browse/track/419240225"
   ```

4. Check if there are any format compatibility issues with this particular track

Based on the help message, there's no specific option for handling DASH streams. Try these approaches:

1. Use a different quality setting:
   ```
   tidal-dl -l "https://tidal.com/browse/track/419240225" -q High
   ```
   or
   ```
   tidal-dl -l "https://tidal.com/browse/track/419240225" -q Normal
   ```

2. Enter the GUI mode to adjust more settings:
   ```
   tidal-dl -g
   ```

3. If those don't work, you might need to check if there's a newer version of tidal-dl that supports DASH+XML stream types, or try using the settings menu:
   ```
   tidal-dl -s
   ```
