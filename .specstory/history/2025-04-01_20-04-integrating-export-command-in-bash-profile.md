# Integrating Export Command in .bash_profile (2025-04-01 13:04:23)

_**User**_

@.bash_profile using the present format and structure, add 
```
export MAKE="make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
```
to this shell config. Analyze it prior to implementation to determine the most appropriate method of integration based on the present format and structure

_**Assistant**_



---

After analyzing your `.bash_profile`, I'll add the MAKE variable to the SYSTEM COMPILER CONFIGURATION section, as it's related to build tools and compiler settings.

```diff
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I${LLVM_PATH}/include -I${PHP_PATH}/include ${CPPFLAGS}"
  export LDFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -L/usr/local/lib -L${LLVM_PATH}/lib -L${LIBUNWIND_PATH} -L${PHP_PATH}/lib ${LDFLAGS}"
+ export MAKE="make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
  
  # PKG-CONFIG AND LIBRARY CONFIGURATION
```
