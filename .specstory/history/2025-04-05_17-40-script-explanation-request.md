# Script Explanation Request (2025-04-05 10:40:06)

_**User**_

walk me thru  this script and explain each step's purpose, required input, and produced output, along with the end output and what to do with it @patcher-macos.sh @fastboot-patcher 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me explain the `patcher-macos.sh` script step by step:

## Overview
This script patches a Samsung device recovery image to bypass security checks, allowing for custom recovery installation.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Utility Functions (lines 3-21)**
   - `message()`: Displays formatted status messages
   - `check_exists()`: Checks if files exist and runs appropriate commands

2. **Environment Setup (lines 23-24)**
   - Sets current script directory
   - Sets a placeholder for empty commands

3. **Dependency Check (lines 27-31)**
   - Verifies python3 is installed
   - Exits if missing

4. **Image Preparation (lines 34-54)**
   - **Input**: Requires either `recovery.img.lz4` or `recovery.img` in script directory
   - **Output**: Creates `raw.img`
   - Decompresses with lz4 if compressed, or renames if uncompressed

5. **Image Editing (lines 57-67)**
   - Searches for "SEANDROIDENFORCE" marker
   - **Output**: Creates `header.img` by extracting image up to that marker
   - Falls back to using entire image if marker not found

6. **Key Generation (lines 70-72)**
   - **Output**: Creates `keys/phh.pem` (4096-bit RSA key) if not present

7. **Image Fragmentation (lines 75-87)**
   - Creates and cleans fragments directory
   - Uses `magiskboot` to unpack the image and extract contents
   - **Output**: Extracts recovery files to fragments directory

8. **Patching Process (lines 90-137)**
   - Applies 16 hex patches to `system/bin/recovery` binary
   - Each patch modifies specific bytes to bypass security checks
   - Repackages patched recovery back into the cpio archive

9. **Image Reassembly (lines 140-145)**
   - **Output**: Creates `output.img` from patched fragments

10. **Image Signing (lines 148-153)**
    - Extracts public key from private key
    - Signs patched image with AVB (Android Verified Boot)
    - **Output**: Adds verification footer to `output.img`

11. **Odin Packaging (lines 156-158)**
    - **Output**: Creates `output.tar` for use with Samsung's Odin flasher

12. **Final Instructions (lines 161-163)**
    - Informs how to flash the patched recovery using fastboot
    - Reminds to also disable verification on vbmeta partition

## Final Outputs:
- `output.img`: Patched recovery image for fastboot
- `output.tar`: Packaged recovery for Odin

## Usage After Running:
Flash the patched recovery with either:
1. `fastboot flash recovery output.img`
2. Or use Odin to flash `output.tar`

Then disable verification with:
`fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img --disable-verity --disable-verification`

Comparison between `patcher` and `patcher-macos.sh`:

## Major Differences

1. **Display Formatting**
   - `patcher`: Uses color formatting with tput commands
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: No color formatting

2. **Function Names**
   - `patcher`: Uses `existance()` function (with typo)
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: Renamed to `check_exists()`

3. **macOS Compatibility**
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: Specifically modified for macOS
   - Modified `dd` command: Replaces `iflag=count_bytes` (not supported in macOS) with alternate method
   - Better path handling with quotes to support spaces in filenames

4. **Error Handling**
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: More robust error handling
   - Adds explicit checks for command failures with `||` operator
   - Provides clearer error messages

5. **Dependencies Check**
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: Explicitly checks for python3 and lz4
   - Provides helpful installation instructions when missing

6. **Directory Management**
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: Properly cleans fragments directory before use
   - Uses safer `mkdir -p` to create directories

7. **Cleanup**
   - `patcher`: Includes cleanup steps at the end (removed in macOS version)
   - Removes temporary files and private key

8. **Packaging**
   - `patcher-macos.sh`: Omits md5sum step for the output.tar file
   - Doesn't rename the output.tar to output.tar.md5

Both scripts perform the same core function - patching a Samsung recovery image to bypass security checks - but the macOS version has been adapted to work properly on macOS systems with their specific command limitations and file handling differences.

The script has been improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Better Dependency Checking**:
   - Now checks for all required tools upfront (python3, lz4, openssl)
   - Verifies magiskboot and avbtool exist in the script directory
   - Provides specific installation instructions for missing dependencies

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added explicit error checking after every critical command
   - Using `|| { error_message; exit 1; }` pattern consistently
   - Provides specific error messages for each potential failure point

3. **Enhanced Directory Management**:
   - Completely removes and recreates fragments directory instead of just emptying it
   - Uses safer `mkdir -p` consistently
   - Adds better error handling for directory operations

4. **Added Cleanup Section**:
   - Removes temporary files (fragments directory, header.img)
   - Renames raw.img back to recovery.img
   - Creates a backup of the public key
   - Removes the private key for security
   - Continues even if cleanup steps fail (with warnings)

These improvements make the script more robust, with better error messaging and security practices, while maintaining macOS compatibility.

Here's a git command sequence for routine repository management after a work session:

```bash
git status && \
git add . && \
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message" && \
git pull --rebase origin main && \
git push origin HEAD
```

Explanation:

1. `git status`: Shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted. Helps review changes before committing.

2. `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory (and subdirectories) for commit. Use `git add -p` instead for interactive staging of specific changes.

3. `git commit -m "message"`: Creates a commit with your staged changes and a descriptive message explaining what you did.

4. `git pull --rebase origin main`: Fetches latest changes from the remote repository and applies your commits on top of them, avoiding merge commits.

5. `git push origin HEAD`: Pushes your current branch to the remote repository.

Additional useful commands:

- `git stash`: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes if you need to switch tasks
- `git branch -D old-branch`: Delete local branches no longer needed
- `git fetch --prune`: Update references and remove branches deleted on remote
- `git checkout -b new-feature`: Create and switch to a new branch for a new feature

Here's a git command sequence for routine repository management in a local-only repository:

```bash
git status && \
git add . && \
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

Explanation:

1. `git status`: Shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted. Helps review changes before committing.

2. `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory (and subdirectories) for commit. Use `git add -p` for interactive staging of specific changes.

3. `git commit -m "message"`: Creates a commit with your staged changes and a descriptive message explaining what you did.

Additional useful local-only commands:

- `git log --oneline -n 10`: View recent commit history in compact format
- `git branch`: List all local branches
- `git checkout -b new-feature`: Create and switch to a new branch
- `git tag v1.0.0`: Create a tag to mark important versions
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1`: Discard the most recent commit (use with caution)
- `git reflog`: View history of all git operations (useful for recovery)

The commit was successful. Your changes are now saved in your local repository with commit ID 81764f0.

Since you're working with a local-only repository, here are some next steps you might consider:

1. Create a backup of your repository:
   ```bash
   git bundle create ../firmware-backup.bundle --all
   ```

2. Tag this version if it's significant:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0 -m "Refactored patcher with improved workflow"
   ```

3. Review your commit history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -n 5
   ```

4. If you need to share this repository with others later, consider:

run @urlpatch.yml

_**Assistant**_

The `urlpatch.yml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration that can't be run directly on your local machine. It's meant to be triggered on GitHub's servers.

The workflow is also incomplete - there's a gap in the "Download recovery image from URL" step where the cursor is positioned.

To fix and use this workflow:

1. First, complete the download step by adding code to save and rename the downloaded file:

```yaml
- name: Download recovery image from URL
  run: |
    wget ${{github.event.inputs.image_url}} -O recovery.img.lz4
```

2. To use this workflow, you need to:
   - Push your repository to GitHub
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
   - Select the "Patch Image via URL" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter the recovery image URL
   - Click "Run workflow" again

If you want to test the patching functionality locally instead:

```bash
wget https://mega.nz/file/IOlGRYjT#xVkHnM1uoNRdiMfLcM7BlxnUENWB_zS7Ek6dI3sPgwQ -O recovery.img.lz4
chmod +x magiskboot patcher-macos
./patcher-macos
```

This will download the image from the URL and run your patching script locally.

_**User**_

why are you saving the IMG file as ALZ4

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The workflow is saving the file as `.lz4` because it assumes the recovery image at the provided URL is LZ4-compressed, which is common for Samsung recovery images.

Looking at the default URL in the workflow:
```
https://mega.nz/file/IOlGRYjT#xVkHnM1uoNRdiMfLcM7BlxnUENWB_zS7Ek6dI3sPgwQ

This appears to be a MEGA file share link that likely contains an LZ4-compressed recovery image.

The `patcher-macos` script is designed to handle both formats:
1. It first checks for `recovery.img.lz4` and decompresses it if found
2. If not found, it looks for an uncompressed `recovery.img`

If the URL actually points to an uncompressed image, you should modify the download step to save it as `recovery.img` instead:

```yaml
wget ${{github.event.inputs.image_url}} -O recovery.img
```

Or make the workflow more versatile by detecting the file type and handling it appropriately.

I see you have uncommitted changes in the "Thor" and "fastboot-patcher" submodules. The "?" suggests you might be confused about something in my previous response or unsure what to do next.

If you're trying to run the workflow locally, you need to address these submodule changes first by either:

1. Committing the changes in the submodules
2. Or discarding the changes with `git restore`

If your question was about the file format, the patcher script handles both compressed (.lz4) and uncompressed recovery images. If the URL points to an uncompressed image, you can save it directly as recovery.img.

If you're asking something else, could you please clarify your question?

To commit changes in your submodules:

```bash
# For the Thor submodule
cd Thor
git add .
git commit -m "Update Thor submodule"
cd ..

# For the fastboot-patcher submodule
cd fastboot-patcher
git add .
git commit -m "Update fastboot-patcher with improved error handling"
cd ..

# Then commit the submodule references in the main repo
git add Thor fastboot-patcher
git commit -m "Update submodule references"
```

This will commit all the changes in both submodules and update their references in your main repository.

why cantt i run those from the root

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You can't run commits for submodule content directly from the root because each submodule is its own separate Git repository.

From the root, Git only tracks which commit of the submodule you're using, not the actual content changes inside it.

You can use this command to commit in all submodules at once from the root:

```bash
git submodule foreach 'git add . && git commit -m "Update submodule" || true'
```

Then commit the submodule references in the main repo:

```bash
git add Thor fastboot-patcher
git commit -m "Update submodule references"
```

The `|| true` prevents the command from failing if a submodule has no changes to commit.

@Linter errors @at_utils.py

_**Assistant**_

Looking at `at_utils.py`, here are the linter errors that would likely be flagged:

1. **Import ordering issues**
   - Standard library imports should be grouped separately from third-party imports
   - Should follow the convention: standard library, third-party imports, local imports

2. **Type annotation issues**
   - The return type for `list_serial_ports()` should be `Optional[list_ports_common.ListPortInfo]` but a single port isn't a list

3. **Line length violations**
   - Several lines exceed PEP 8's recommended 79 character limit

4. **Indentation inconsistency**
   - The multi-line print statement has inconsistent indentation

5. **Redundant code**
   - In `at_send()`, multiple return conditions could be simplified

Here's how to fix these issues:

```python
# Fix import ordering
import time
from typing import List, Optional, Union

import serial  # Third-party imports after standard library
import serial.tools.list_ports as prtlst
from serial.tools import list_ports_common

# Fix return type annotation
def list_serial_ports() -> Optional[list_ports_common.ListPortInfo]:
    """List available serial ports and return the first one."""
    # ...

# Fix line length and indentation
    print(
        "Since your device was detected by usbswitcher.py, "
        "USB debugging might already be enabled."
    )

    choice = (
        input("Do you want to attempt enabling USB debugging via AT commands? (y/n, default=n): ")
        or "n"
    )
```

The code is generally well-structured and follows Python conventions. These small improvements would satisfy most linters.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
`typing.List` is deprecated, use `list` instead
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Replace `List` with lowercase `list` in Python 3.9+ code:

```python
# Change this line
from typing import List, Optional, Union

# To this
from typing import Optional, Union
```

Then update the function parameter type annotation:

```python
# Change this
def try_at_cmds(io: serial.Serial, cmds: List[str]) -> None:

# To this
def try_at_cmds(io: serial.Serial, cmds: list[str]) -> None:
```

This uses Python's built-in `list` type annotation which is preferred in Python 3.9 and later.

The workflow has been updated to use `uv` instead of Conda:

1. Replaced Conda setup with Python setup directly
2. Added a step to install `uv` package manager
3. Simplified dependency installation with `uv pip install`
4. Changed the linting and testing commands to use `uv pip run`

This approach offers several advantages:
- Much faster package installation
- Deterministic builds with better dependency resolution
- Simpler workflow without the overhead of Conda
- Compatible with existing requirements.txt files

Note that if you were using Conda-specific packages not available on PyPI, you'll need to ensure those are available through other means or add them to your requirements.txt.

Looking at the GitHub Actions run failure, it's showing "Process completed with exit code 2" in the build process. Based on the workflow file and error, there's a problem with installing dependencies using UV.

The most likely issue is that your repository doesn't have a `requirements.txt` file, or the file exists but has invalid dependencies or formatting.

Here's how to fix it:

1. First, check if a `requirements.txt` file exists in your repository root:
```bash
ls -la
```

2. If it doesn't exist, create one with your project dependencies:
```bash
# Example requirements.txt
pyserial>=3.5
pytest>=7.0.0
flake8>=5.0.0
```

3. If the file exists, modify the workflow to handle potential errors:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then
      uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    else
      echo "No requirements.txt found, creating one"
      echo "pyserial>=3.5" > requirements.txt
      uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    fi
```

4. Alternatively, you could update the workflow to install explicit dependencies:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    uv pip install pyserial flake8 pytest
```

This approach is more resilient when you don't have a requirements file and ensures the critical packages needed for your workflow are installed.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
The target framework 'net7.0' is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future. Please refer to https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-support for more information about the support policy.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Update your project file to use a supported .NET version:

```xml
<!-- Change this -->
<TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>

<!-- To this -->
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

.NET 7.0 is end-of-life. .NET 8.0 is the current LTS version that will receive long-term support and security updates.

Alternatively, if you need to keep using .NET 7.0 despite the warning, you can suppress it:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CheckEolTargetFramework>false</CheckEolTargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

But upgrading to .NET 8.0 is the recommended solution for security and support.

@Microsoft.NET.EolTargetFrameworks.targets revert to its original state w/ sudo

---

_**Assistant**_



---

To revert this system file to its original state, you'll need to reinstall the .NET SDK package. Here's how to do it with sudo:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/10.0.100-preview.2.25164.34/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.EolTargetFrameworks.targets
sudo dotnet-install.sh --channel 10.0.1xx-preview2 --quality preview
```

Alternatively, if you just need a clean copy of the file:

```bash
# Download the original file 
sudo curl -o /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/10.0.100-preview.2.25164.34/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.EolTargetFrameworks.targets https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/sdk/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.EolTargetFrameworks.targets
```

If needed, you can also adjust file permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/10.0.100-preview.2.25164.34/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.EolTargetFrameworks.targets
```
